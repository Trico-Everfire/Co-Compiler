This application is a syncronous process executor meant as a standalone replacement for Source Engine's Hammer's map compiler menu.
Although not as straightforward to use, it has more functionality over the original and even circumvents certain bugs with running
processes in Hammer (like the processes running slower if the Hammer window is unfocussed). It allows you to import your existing
confirgurations from Hammer.
